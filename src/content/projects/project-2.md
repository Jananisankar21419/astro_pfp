**Note:** This is a challenge for hiring Front-end Developer from X(twitter).<br> The CEO of Dukaan hosted this challenge and here is the  [figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/1QTpfgcJLng3SEHv3V7Nr4/Payouts-V2---2023?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=kgpJwleaFWt52rEK-1).

 i used `create-react-app` to bootstrap my project and then started with setting up the basic structure by creating components for Header, Sidebar. 

 For styling I used TailwindCSS for all the styling because lets face it, CSS is really fricking hard. Tailwind just makes it really simple and quick to make a stunning UI. Just add pre-built CSS utility classes and its amazing! 

 i used `lucide-react` for icons which made  it easy to use and customize them as per my requirements.

 This is the first project that i did't use CSS but used TailwindCSS and I did lot of mistakes in import dependencies and responsive styling and faced isues in  `localhost/3000`.
 
 i didn't win this challenge  but learned a lot about how to structure components in react, how to design using TailwindCSS.
 TailwindCSS is made me realize  how much I missed CSS when working with React, so I decided to learn TailwindCSS and learn to make UI Components.
