Its a fun project that i learnt from youtube tutorials.
**You can see**[ here](https://be-thirfty-frontend.vercel.app/).
<br>
This project was a great learning experience for me . Things i learnt while making "**Be Thrifty**" : <br>

1. CSS Grids<br>
2. Using MongoDB<br>


Before this **i had made a simple**[ amazon clone](https://github.com/Jananisankar21419/eSHOP) to get comfortable with using Javascript in React Projects. I'm absolutely in love with it. Javascript is just so good to use in my projects.

I used Basic CSS for styling the website and MongoDB as my database.

I used `create-react-app` for this project which provides a simple way to create a new React application.

Finally i learnt how to use mongoDB with NodeJS and  while learning i found Thunder client ( REST API) VS Code extension for API testing  which is light-weight and game changer.

The main idea behind creating **Be Thrifty** is to connect people who are willing to sell their old clothes with those who need them.

In the front end I created all the components needed for displaying products, user profiles , adding/removing items from cart etc. The website , I created all the components inside the front end folder, there are three folders namely -

1. Public - Contains all the static files (Images , Icons etc.)
2. Components - Contains reusable components(Header , Footer , Hero...etc)
3. Pages - Contains pages of the App (Login, Login/Signup Page , Product Page, Shop, Shop Category).
